## Process

1. Planning 

    Since this project's focus is on code organisation, I started by making a diagram (first time ever) of the modules i would use and how they would interact with each other.

    I decided to also implement a pubsub/mediator module, to handle the interaction between all the modules since I think its a valuable skill to have in making large projects clean. So this will be a learning experience in multiple fronts.
